# EMDigIt-Italian-Itineraries
EMDigIt (Early Modern Digital Itineraries) explores spatial data in early modern travel guides. It processes route details, stops, and points of interest from historic itinerary books using Python, mapping tools, and text recognition. The project aims to visualize journeys and build an interactive mapping platform.


**EMDigIt: Early Modern Digital Itineraries**  
**Project Overview**  
EMDigIt (Early Modern Digital Itineraries) is a digital humanities project that explores the spatial, textual, and cultural data embedded in early modern itinerary books. These itineraries—small, affordable travel guides from the early modern period—provided routes, stops, points of interest, and tools for navigating foreign customs, language, and currency.  

The project began during Rachel Midura's time as a digital humanities research fellow at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. Initially, EMDigIt focused on compiling route headers, such as “From Rome to Madrid via Milan,” which were well-suited for network analysis. However, the project has expanded to include intermediary stops, detailed waypoints, and rich spatial information on hospitality, pilgrimage, trade, and conflict.  

**Core Features**  
- **Data Extraction**: Combining hand curation, PDF digitization, and tools like Transkribus for handwritten text recognition, EMDigIt processes semi-structured data from historic itinerary books.  
- **Visualization**: Maps created with tools like Palladio demonstrate not only origin-destination routes but also intermediary stops, georeconciled locations, and estimated waypoints using distance and bearings.  
- **Web Platform Vision**: An envisioned EMDigIt platform will allow users to map journeys, calculate travel details (e.g., cost, time, elevation), and explore historical points of interest, such as customs posts or landmarks.  

**Milestones**  
- **Spring 2023**: Awarded a Virginia Tech Digital Humanities Library Collaboration Grant to refine workflows and create platform wireframes.  
- **August 2023**: Received a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support workshops in Spring and Summer 2024.
- **August 2023**: Hosted Early Modern Digital Itineraries culminating workshop and in-person conference in conjunction with DH2024 in Arlington, Virginia. 
- **April 2025**: Published EMDigIt white paper and initial project code

**Technologies**  
- Transkribus for handwritten text recognition 
- Python Notebooks for data processing  
- Geospatial tools (Recogito, ArcGIS) for mapping and reconciliation

**Future Goals**  
- Develop an interactive web-based platform for mapping and exploring early modern itineraries.  
- Expand functionality for analyzing historical travel costs, modes, and spatial relationships.
